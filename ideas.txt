1. Flipping/Merching - Buy low, sell high on regular items
    - Track price movements over time
    - Identify underpriced items
    - Show potential profit margins
  2. Alching - Buy items cheap, alch them for profit
    - High alch value vs GE price
    - Requires Fire runes cost calculation
    - Good for steady profit
  3. Crafting Flips - Buy raw materials, craft items, sell finished products
    - Jewelry (rings, amulets)
    - Armor/weapons
    - Compare material cost vs final item value
  4. Herblore Flips - Similar to potions but:
    - Grinding herbs into powder
    - Creating unfinished potions
    - Adding secondary ingredients
    - Comparing all stages
  5. Cooking - Buy raw food, cook it, sell cooked
    - Fish, meat, etc.
    - Show profit per item
  6. Tanning/Leather Working - Buy hides, tan them, sell leather
    - Multiple leather types
    - Show tanner costs
  7. Smithing - Buy ore, smelt into bars, forge into items
    - Calculate coal/mithril costs
    - Show profit at each stage
  8. Gem Cutting - Buy uncut gems, cut them, sell
    - Diamond, ruby, sapphire, emerald profits
  9. Log Flipping - Buy logs, process into planks, sell
    - Different wood types
    - Plank maker costs
  10. Rune Crafting - Buy rune essence, craft runes, sell
    - Different rune types
    - Compare pure essence vs runes

  Which would interest you most? I'd recommend starting with:
  - Alching (simple, high turnover)
  - Herblore Flips (similar to what you're already doing)
  - Gem Cutting (good profit margins, limited items to track)

  Should I implement one of these next?

> Which do you think could be the most profitable?

⏺ Based on OSRS economics, I'd rank them by profitability potential:

  Top 3 Most Profitable:

  1. Alching - Most profitable for effort ratio
    - High alch values are fixed, so you just find underpriced items
    - Fire rune cost is negligible (~5gp)
    - Profit margins can be 10-30%+ on good items
    - Fast turnover (instant alch, instant sell back)
    - No skill/time investment needed
    - Examples: Rune items, jewelry, weapons often have 20%+ alch margins
  2. Herblore Flips (like your potions)
    - What you're already doing with potions
    - Consistent demand (PvM, skilling)
    - Good volume = reliable flips
    - 5-25% profit margins are common
    - But slower than alching (need to buy components, make potions, sell)
  3. Gem Cutting
    - Onyx, diamond, ruby, sapphire cutting
    - Can have 15-30%+ margins
    - But lower volume than potions
    - Requires tracking fewer items

  Why Alching is probably #1:
  - The GE prices change daily, so there are always underpriced items
  - You're comparing current GE price vs FIXED high alch value
  - Takes ~2 seconds per item to alch
  - Can do it while doing other things
  - People constantly merch items poorly, creating alch opportunities

  The catch:
  - Requires active trading (buying + alching + selling)
  - Less "set and forget" than potions
  - Margins vary by item, need to find the good ones

  My recommendation: Implement Alching next. It's simpler to build (fewer calculations), potentially more profitable, and less dependent on volume data. You'd:
  1. Show all items with high alch values from the API
  2. Compare to current GE price
  3. Highlight items with >10% margin
  4. Sort by profit potential
